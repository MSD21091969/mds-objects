feat: Project restructuring and initial setup

This commit includes a major restructuring of the project, moving components and core functionalities into a new `src` directory structure.

Key changes include:
- Relocation of various modules to `src/components` and `src/core`.
- Introduction of placeholder files for `PubSubManager`, `EmbeddingsManager`, `DocumentParser`, and `CasefileRole` to resolve immediate `ModuleNotFoundError` issues during server startup. These placeholders will need to be properly implemented.
- Initial fixes for import paths to align with the new structure.

The server is not yet fully functional, as further implementation of placeholder modules and potential dependency issues need to be addressed.
